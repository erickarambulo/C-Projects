# C-Projects
For this short projects that I created is based on the instructions I gave to a Gemini AI. I assigned and trained my AI to become my C++ tutor, and prompt me to provide my codes in C++. After providing my codes to AI, it provides me feedbacks, corrections, and create a new projects to work on. Those projects are based on Chapter 1 to 6.
